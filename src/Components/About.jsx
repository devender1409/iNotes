      <h4>Note-taking is a pretty personal thing. Some people are meticulous in their notebook organization, with careful folders, subheads, and bullets. Others, myself among them, take more of a scrawl-it-anywhere-you-can approach. However you like to take notes—whether they're text-only or elaborate scrapbooks—there's a notes app out there that can handle all your weird quirks and note-taking needs.

      First, one big thing to mention. You can write notes anywhere: on the back of a napkin, envelope, important bill, or even in a notebook. It's kind of similar with apps: you can stick notes into pretty much any old app, even if it's not really designed for them. Example: Google Docs isn't a great notes app, but I have notes about this article you're reading now in the Google Doc I'm working from.</h4>
